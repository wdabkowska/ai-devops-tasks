How can I solve high memory usage in a Docker container?
    To solve high memory usage in a Docker container:
    Set memory limits: Use --memory (e.g., --memory="512m") when running containers to cap usage.
    Optimize the app: Profile memory usage inside the container with tools like top, htop, or language-specific profilers to find leaks or inefficient code.
    Use smaller base images: Lightweight images like alpine reduce overhead.

You are an experienced DevOps Engineer with 10 years of practice. How can I solve high memory usage in a Docker container?
    As an experienced DevOps engineer, here’s how I’d approach high memory usage in a Docker container:

1. Set Resource Limits
Start by explicitly limiting memory to prevent containers from consuming all host RAM:

bash
Copy
Edit
docker run --memory="512m" --memory-swap="1g" my-container
--memory: Hard limit.

--memory-swap: Includes memory + swap.

2. Profile Inside the Container
Exec into the container and use tools like:

top, htop, or ps aux --sort=-%mem

App-level tools: node --inspect, jmap, Valgrind, etc.

This helps pinpoint which process or function is hogging memory.

3. Optimize the Application
Fix memory leaks (e.g., in long-running loops, cache misuse).

Release unused resources (buffers, connections).

Use streaming instead of loading large data into memory.

4. Use Slimmer Base Images
Switch to minimal base images (alpine, slim) to reduce memory footprint.

5. Enable OOM Logging
Inspect logs for out-of-memory (OOM) kills:

bash
Copy
Edit
dmesg | grep -i oom
6. Monitor Over Time
Use tools like:

docker stats

Prometheus + Grafana

cAdvisor

This gives visibility into usage patterns and helps catch gradual leaks.

Comparison: The general answer was concise and listed basic steps like setting memory limits and checking with top. 
The specialized answer, from a DevOps engineer's perspective, was far more detailed—it included exact commands, profiling tools, app-level optimizations, and monitoring strategies. 
The specialized response reflects deeper expertise and real-world troubleshooting practices.
