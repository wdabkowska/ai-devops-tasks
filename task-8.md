ERROR: for app  Cannot start service app: driver failed programming external connectivity on endpoint app (172.18.0.2): Error starting userland proxy: listen tcp4 0.0.0.0:3000: bind: address already in use

What does this error mean and how can I fix it?

  This error means Docker is trying to map the container’s port 3000 to your host’s port 3000, but that host port is already in use by another application or process. Because two programs can’t listen on the same port simultaneously, Docker fails to start the container.

How to fix it:
Identify what’s using port 3000 on your host:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo lsof -i :3000
or

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo netstat -tulpn | grep :3000
Stop or kill the process using that port if possible:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo kill <PID>
Or change the port mapping when running the container to use a different host port, for example:

bash
Copy
Edit
docker run -p 3001:3000 your-image
This maps container’s port 3000 to host port 3001 instead.

If you’re using Docker Compose, update the ports section to use an available port:

yaml
Copy
Edit
ports:
  - "3001:3000"
