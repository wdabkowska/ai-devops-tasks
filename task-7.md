Explain this script line by line as if to a beginner.

Absolutely! Here’s a simple, beginner-friendly explanation of each line in the script:

bash
Copy
Edit
#!/bin/bash
This tells the system to use the Bash shell to run the script.

bash
Copy
Edit
if systemctl is-active --quiet docker; then
This checks if the Docker service is running quietly (without output).

If Docker is running, it moves to the next line inside the then block.

bash
Copy
Edit
  echo "Docker is already running."
This prints the message letting you know Docker is running.

bash
Copy
Edit
else
This means if Docker is not running, do what’s inside the next block.

bash
Copy
Edit
  echo "Docker is not running. Starting Docker..."
Prints a message saying Docker will be started now.

bash
Copy
Edit
  sudo systemctl start docker
Runs the command to start the Docker service.

sudo is used to get admin (root) permissions because starting services requires them.

bash
Copy
Edit
  if systemctl is-active --quiet docker; then
Checks again if Docker is running after trying to start it.

bash
Copy
Edit
    echo "Docker started successfully."
If Docker is now running, it prints a success message.

bash
Copy
Edit
  else
    echo "Failed to start Docker."
  fi
If Docker still isn’t running, it prints an error message.

fi closes the inner if statement.

bash
Copy
Edit
fi
This closes the main if statement.
