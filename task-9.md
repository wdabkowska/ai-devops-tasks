is it valid?

services:
  web:
    image: nginx
    ports:
      - "80:80"
  app:
    build: .
    ports
      - "3000:3000"
    depends_on:
      - db
  db:
    image: postgres
    environment:
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password


The Docker Compose snippet you shared has a small syntax error. Hereâ€™s the corrected version with explanations:

yaml
Copy
Edit
services:
  web:
    image: nginx
    ports:
      - "80:80"
  app:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"      # <-- Fixed missing colon here
    depends_on:
      - db
  db:
    image: postgres
    environment:
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: password
What was wrong?
In the app service, you wrote ports without a colon (ports instead of ports:).

In YAML, colons after keys are mandatory.

With that fixed, this Compose file is valid.
