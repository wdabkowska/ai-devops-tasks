Why is it important to ignore these files?

Great question! Ignoring these files is important because:

node_modules/ can contain thousands of files that are large and easily recreated by running npm install, so committing them bloats your repo unnecessarily.

Log files and .env often contain sensitive info or temporary data that shouldn’t be shared or clutter your version history.

Local database folders (data/, mongo-data/) store runtime data that’s specific to your machine and environment—committing them would cause conflicts and unnecessary bloat.

Ignoring OS and editor files like .DS_Store keeps your repo clean from unrelated clutter that doesn’t affect the code.

Overall, .gitignore helps keep your repo lightweight, secure, and focused only on source code and config that truly matters.
