dockerfile node
    # Use the official Node.js image as a base
  FROM node:18
  
  # Set the working directory inside the container
  WORKDIR /app
  
  # Copy package.json and package-lock.json first for dependency installation
  COPY package*.json ./
  
  # Install dependencies
  RUN npm install
  
  # Copy the rest of the application files
  COPY . .
  
  # Expose the port the app runs on
  EXPOSE 3000
  
  # Define the command to run the app
  CMD ["node", "app.js"]

  Write a simple Dockerfile for a Node.js app that:
- uses Node 18 as the base image
- copies package.json and package-lock.json
- installs dependencies
- copies the rest of the app files
- exposes port 3000
- starts the app with "npm start"
  # Use Node 18 as the base image
    FROM node:18
    
    # Set working directory inside the container
    WORKDIR /app
    
    # Copy dependency definitions
    COPY package.json package-lock.json ./
    
    # Install dependencies
    RUN npm install
    
    # Copy the rest of the application files
    COPY . .
    
    # Expose port 3000
    EXPOSE 3000
    
    # Start the application
    CMD ["npm", "start"]


Comparison: With the unstructured prompt (dockerfile node), the response was generic and assumed defaults like app.js and node to run the app. 
The structured prompt gave clear instructions, resulting in a precise, minimal Dockerfile tailored exactly to your requirements. Structured prompts lead to faster, more accurate results.
